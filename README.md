## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset Source:** [Uber Fares Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset) 
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas), Power BI Desktop
- **Objective:** Gain insights into fare patterns, time trends, and ride behaviors using data analysis and visual storytelling.


## 🔍 Project Phases

### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Loaded raw data using Pandas
- Assessed data quality, types, and structure
- Cleaned dataset (handled missing values, outliers, and format issues)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized fare distribution
- Analyzed correlations between fare amount, distance, and time
- Detected outliers and patterns

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted hour, day, month from timestamps
- Categorized peak vs. off-peak hours
- Encoded new categorical variables

### 4. Power BI Visualization
- Imported enhanced dataset
- Designed time-series and geographic visuals
- Highlighted busiest periods and seasonal variations
